# Tuple-Iterator-with-Callbacks
Problem statemnet (C+11):

A strcuture has different members and each member has respective processing functions (callbacks) and the resultant value is derived from all the processed value. 

This is work in progress and this solves the problem for C+11. 

P.S. Since with C++17 tuple iterator this problem can be solved more easily.
